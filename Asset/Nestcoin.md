# Nestcoin Film-House/Cinema

Nestcoin is a film house that would like to further engage with their audience. They have Interestingly began accepting crypto-based payments a year earlier and would like to harness the power of Web3 to implement their solution.

## Problem Statement

They would like to:
1. Create a "currency", which would be used to reward loyal customers. 
2. The currency could later be traded for backstage passes and other perks.

## Task
We have been contacted to develop a system that allows Nestcoin to batch transactions in order of 200 addresses. This would enable admins for the organisation to distribute their "currency" as quickly and efficiently as possible.

## Solution

The team had a meeting to ideate the problem and after a successful meeting, we came up with some solutions but had to drill down to one because of several factor such as time available for the project.

We have created two contracts one to distribute the minted token to the customers, while the other would be to exchange the currency for services amd other preks.
The frontend was created to help admin distribute the token which is a form of rewarding loyal customers. The service or buyby part of the frontend would not be implemented as the task did not require us to handle that now.

We also but in a security aspect which would allow us to add and also remove admin as when we want it. But note that only admin can add another.

Finanlly we needed a way to keep track of the token and also usage/claim so we added the analytics part to the frontend.

The project was finakky deployed and the link to the live prototype is [Here](https://#)
